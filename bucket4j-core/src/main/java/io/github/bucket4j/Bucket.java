     * Replaces configuration of this bucket.
     *
     * <p>
     * The first hard problem of configuration replacement is making decision how to propagate available tokens from bucket with previous configuration to bucket with new configuration.
     * If you don't care about previous bucket state then use {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#RESET}.
     * But it becomes to a tricky problem when we expect that previous consumption(that has not been compensated by refill yet) should take effect to the bucket with new configuration.
     * In this case you need to make a choice between {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#PROPORTIONALLY} and {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#AS_IS}, read documentation about both with strong attention.
     *
     * <p> There is another problem when you are choosing {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#PROPORTIONALLY} and {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#AS_IS} and bucket has more then one bandwidth.
     * For example how does replaceConfiguration implementation should bind bandwidths to each other in the following example?
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     *     Bucket bucket = Bucket.builder()
     *                       .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(10, Duration.ofSeconds(1)))
     *                       .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(10000, Duration.ofHours(1)))
     *                       .build();
     *     ...
     *     BucketConfiguration newConfiguration = BucketConfiguratiion.builder()
     *                                               .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(5000, Duration.ofHours(1)))
     *                                               .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(100, Duration.ofSeconds(10)))
     *                                               .build();
     *     bucket.replaceConfiguration(newConfiguration, TokensInheritanceStrategy.AS_IS);
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     * It is obviously that simple strategy - copying tokens by bandwidth index will not work well in this case, because of it highly depends from order.
     * Instead of inventing the backward maggic Bucket4j provides to you ability to deap controll of this process by specifying identifiers for bandwidth,
     * so in case of multiple bandwidth configuratoin replacement code can copy available tokens by bandwidth ID. So it is better to rewrite code above as following:
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     * Bucket bucket = Bucket.builder()
     *                            .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(10, Duration.ofSeconds(1)).withId("technical-limit"))
     *                            .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(10000, Duration.ofHours(1)).withId("business-limit"))
     *                            .build();
     * ...
     * BucketConfiguration newConfiguration = BucketConfiguratiion.builder()
     *                            .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(5000, Duration.ofHours(1)).withId("business-limit"))
     *                            .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(100, Duration.ofSeconds(10)).withId("technical-limit"))
     *                            .build();
     * bucket.replaceConfiguration(newConfiguration, TokensInheritanceStrategy.AS_IS);
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     *
     *
     * <p>
 *     There are following rules for bandwidth identifiers:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>
     *          By default bandwidth has <b>null</b> identifier.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         null value of identifier equals to another null value if and only if there is only one bandwidth with null identifier.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         If identifier for bandwidth is specified then it must has unique in the bucket. Bucket does not allow to create several bandwidth with same ID.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#RESET} strategy will be applied for tokens migration during config replacement for bandwidth which has no bound bandwidth with same ID in previous configuration,
     *         idependently of strategy that was requested.
     *     </li>
     * </ul>

     * @param tokensInheritanceStrategy specifies the rules for inheritance of available tokens
