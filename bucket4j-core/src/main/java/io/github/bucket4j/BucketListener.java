/**
 * Interface for listening bucket related events. The typical use-cases of this interface are logging and monitoring.
 * The bucket can be decorated by listener via {@link Bucket#toListenable(BucketListener)} method.
 *
 * <h3>Question: How many listeners is need to create in case of application uses many buckets?</h3>
 * <b>Answer:</b>  it depends:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>If you want to have aggregated statistics for all buckets then create single listener per application and reuse this listener for all buckets.</li>
 *     <li>If you want to measure statistics independently per each bucket then use listener per bucket model.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Question: where is methods of listener are invoking in case of distributed usage?</h3>
 * <b>Answer:</b> listener always invoked on client side, it is means that each client JVM will have own totally independent  for same bucket.
 *
 * <h3>Question: Why does bucket invoke the listener on client side instead of server side in case of distributed scenario?
 * What I need to do if I need in aggregated stat across the whole cluster?</h3>
 * <b>Answer:</b> Because of planned expansion to non-JVM back-ends such as Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
 * It is not possible to serialize and invoke listener on this non-java back-ends, so it was decided to invoke listener on client side,
 * in order to avoid inconsistency between different back-ends in the future.
 * You can do post-aggregation of monitoring statistics via features built-into your monitoring database or via mediator(like StatsD) between your application and monitoring database.
