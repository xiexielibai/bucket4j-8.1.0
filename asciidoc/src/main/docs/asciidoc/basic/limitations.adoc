=== Technical limitations
To provide the best precision, Bucket4j uses integer arithmetic as much as possible, so any internal calculation is limited by bound ``Long.MAX_VALUE``. The library introduces several limits that are described further, to be sure that calculations will never exceed the bound.

==== Maximum refill rate
The maximum refill rate is limited by ``1 token/ 1 nanosecond``. Following examples of API usage will raise exceptions

[source, java]
----
Bandwidth.simple(2, Duration.ofNanos(1));
----
[source, java]
----
Bandwidth.simple(1001, Duration.ofNanos(1000));
----
[source, java]
----
Bandwidth.simple(1_000_001, Duration.ofMillis(1));
----

==== Limitation for refill period
Bucket4j works with time intervals as the 64-bit number of nanoseconds. So maximum refill period that is possible will be:
[source, java]
----
Duration.ofNanos(Long.MAX_VALUE);
----
Any attempt to specify a period longer than the limit above will fail with an exception. For example, the code below will failed
[source, java]
----
Bandwidth.simple(42, Duration.ofMinutes(153722867280912930));
